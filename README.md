# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Core
The RISC-V Single Cycle Core project designs a basic processor in Verilog executing each instruction in one clock cycle. It features instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages, implementing a subset of the RISC-V ISA, aiding in understanding processor design and RISC-V architecture.
